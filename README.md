In this data I have worked on EDA and found various outcomes
Here are the conclusions that I have found :- 

• After conducting EDA we can say that alot of leads decline due to high prices and online classes

• Majority of leads are from social media platform, so we can focus on advertising more on social media

• Also alot of leads are not converted because we fail to make them consider about conversion, the sales team needs to be worked on

• Since majority of students do not attend demo they are not aware of the classes provided. This leads to less people looking into considering aboit taking admission

• At the end offline classes should be considered so that the students who are not comfortable with online classes can attend offline institutes
